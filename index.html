            <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>
        <div class = aboutText>I'm currently in my final year at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, eagerly anticipating my graduation in May 2024. My academic journey has been centered around my passion for Computer Science, and I've had the privilege of honing my skills in areas such as C++, C#, and even delving into Assembly Language. As I look forward to my impending graduation, I'm excited to embark on a journey of learning that includes CSS, HTML, and Python, broadening my skill set to encompass web development and more. My insatiable curiosity and eagerness to learn have always been driving forces in my life, and I can't wait to see where my evolving skills will take me in the future.
            Outside of the tech world, one of my greatest passions is playing the guitar, with a particular love for Rock and Metal music. You'll often find me jamming to classics from bands like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Guns N' Roses, and many others. Music has a special place in my heart, providing both relaxation and inspiration in my life.
            With a blend of technical expertise and a love for music, I'm excited to embrace all that the future holds for me, both in the world of technology and in my personal pursuits.
